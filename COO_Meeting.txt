As per the requirements of the Assignment A2 we had a meeting with the COO Ahsan Naseem to understand the Business Plan and Business Model of Coeus Solutions.

Following is the detailed report of my understanding of the meeting.

-> Business Model:

     ->Coeus Solutions business model is divided into two main parts:

            -> Dedicated Development
            -> Fixed Price Contract

     ->Dedicated Development:

        In dedicated environment is actually the offshore development contract environment where the developer works as 	the dedicated employee of the offshore company.
        Following are the characteristics of the Coeus Dedicated Development Contract:

            ->The company's project that requires dedicated services of coeus's employee should be at least three months long.

            ->Services for 20 man days will be provided by coeus to its offshore client.

            ->If monthly works exceeds 20 man days by 2 i.e. if the employee works for 22 days in a month then no extra 	      money is charged but if it exceeds 22 days then per hour development fee is charged.

            ->Similarly no charges will be deducted by the client if a employee works no less than 18 days.

            ->Coeus gives a facility of reviewing the code by one of their Team Leads once a month.

    ->Fixed Price Contract

        In this model the client company generates its project initial requirements and coeus proposes a fixes 		 	development price according to the requirements. And the price changes as the requirements changes.

->Client Capturing:

    Client capturing is the most important part of the Coeus's Business Model:
    As for now coeus works with clients from Germany, Austria and Switzerland only where most of the clients are from germany.

    Types of Client Capturing:

        1.Coeus makes strategic partnerships with other companies.
        2.Another way is of non-partnerships clients where clients come with their project requirements and coeus changes their
          requirements into product.

    ->Direct end-client approach(one time clients)

        1.Cold Calling
		Company representatives call different companies and individual having onlines business and offer them 		services to make their online business upto date and to add new features.
        2.Trade Shows
		Company participates in different trade shows and events that may help company attract clients.
        3.Twego 
		Twego is a online similar to odesk but the difference is that this site is not free or for freelancers 		but for small or middle size registered companies.

->Working Strategy:

    ->Coeus likes to be in a startup, being in a start-up mode helps the company and employees to learn new things and       technologies.
    ->Working strategy of the company may change with the opportunity course correction.

->Money Flow:

    ->As main company is in Berlin,Germany so all the money flows from their to the Lahore development center.
    ->At the end of month Lahore office sends the invoices to the german office and they pay back the with the required amounts.
->Top Clients:
     -> Meta Design
     -> E-Comme
     -> House Pilot
     

->Competition:

    ->In Lahore coeus only has resource competition, obviously every company wants to have a group of best resources.
    ->As coeus works with the german clients so it does not have any business competition in Lahore.

Future Plans:

    -> Coeus future plans include hiring a Phd doctor that would help the company's employees and operations to become 	more structured.
    -> Another plan for coeus is to hire a top level sales manager that would make the sales of the company go higher.
    -> There has been a debate about changing the location of the office for the past year and in future the office may 	be shifted to some other location.
